During this homework assignment I learned ALOT.
I started with p5.js, learning a bit about how it works, what it's for and in what situation I might use it.

Then I started learning about APIs. I did a codeacademy course on APIs and began to understand their syntax and structure and how to use them. I learned the importance of using the documentation, and how much a bummer the Instagram documentation is (it kinda sucks). This was one of the biggest issues I faced, I spent a lot of time just troubleshooting how specifically instagram wanted me to interact with their API. Plus, Instagram just changed how their API works a few months ago, so basically all the possible example code I found online was innacurate. 

I also learned a little bit about jQuery and AJAX as I needed to use AJAX in order to use instagram's RESTful API. 
I ended up doing a lot of my coding in pure javascript, as it made more sense to use than p5 when calling data from an API. This was a learning experience in itself as I don't have a ton of JS experience. Easily the hardest part of this whole assignment was trying to figure out how to dive into the array of data that the API returned in order to grab and display the image.
